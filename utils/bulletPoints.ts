	"• Think of a bullet point as a mini headline. It needs to be concise and attention-grabbing in a way that intrigues readers and compels them to read more.",
	"• Highlight elements key to understanding the content of your article. There’s no room for fluff here, so call out what’s most important.",
	"• Keep it simple. Avoid complex outlines and don’t use sub-bullets if you can help it.",
	"• Keep bullets thematically related. Bullet points highlight key elements of very specific topics, so stay on a single track.",
	"• Make your bullet points symmetrical . . . just like the ones here. Notice how each point begins with a bolded directive and ends with a one-sentence explanation.",
	"• Work in keywords. Search engines tend to give bulleted lists a little more weight.",
	"• Don’t overdo it. You want your post to look like an article, not a grocery list.",
